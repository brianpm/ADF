def global_latlon_map(adfobj):
    """
    This script/function is designed to generate global
    2-D lat/lon maps of model fields with continental overlays.

    This script is actually the same as 'plot_example', except
    that it uses the shared diagnostics plotting library, as
    opposed to being entirely self-contained.

    Description of function inputs:

    case_name        -> Name of CAM case provided by "cam_case_name".
    model_rgrid_loc  -> Location of re-gridded CAM climo files provided by "cam_regrid_loc".
    data_name        -> Name of data set CAM case is being compared against,
                        which is always either "obs" or the baseline CAM case name,
                        depending on whether "compare_obs" is true or false.
    data_loc         -> Location of comparison data, which is either "obs_climo_loc"
                        or "cam_baseline_climo_loc", depending on whether
                        "compare_obs" is true or false.
    var_list         -> List of CAM output variables provided by "diag_var_list"
    data_list        -> List of data sets CAM will be compared against, which
                        is simply the baseline case name in situations when
                        "compare_obs" is false.
    plot_location    -> Location where plot files will be written to, which is
                        specified by "cam_diag_plot_loc".

    opt              -> optional,
                        if dict : that has keys that are variable names and values that are plotting preferences/defaults.
                        if str  : path to a YAML file that conforms to the dict option.
